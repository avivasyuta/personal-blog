# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that makes building web applications a breeze. In this post, we'll explore the basics.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides many features out of the box:

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Better SEO and initial load performance
2. **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-render pages at build time
3. **API Routes** - Build your backend in the same project
4. **File-based Routing** - No configuration needed

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

That's it! You're ready to start building.
